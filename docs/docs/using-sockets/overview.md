# Overview

## What are Syncano Sockets?

Syncano Sockets are configurations for the core services offered by Syncano. They are easily configured, combined, and created using the Syncano CLI, Dashboard or our API.

- No, they're not the things on your wall that you plug electrical devices into.
- They are the things in Syncano that you plug your core app functionality into! They are "outlets" for your creativity. Let me explain..

> Sockets are outlets for your creativity

Think of Syncano as the kitchen where you are the chef, code and Sockets are your ingredients. You don’t have to start from scratch in this kitchen, you can simply take things off the shelf, mix them together any way you want to, and not have to wait around for the next harvest.

Those ingredients are the core services that Syncano offers, such as Data Storage, Scripts (server-side code), and User Management to name a few. Take these, add some spices (configurations), and you've got yourself a Socket. With Syncano Sockets you have what is needed to assemble your first backend. You just piece the Syncano Sockets together and you can build an endless variety of dedicated backends for your app!


## Sounds awesome! But I need more!

Okay okay, so Sockets are the layers stacked between:
1. Syncano’s Cloud OS on top of the cloud infrastructure
2. Third party services
3. Your application

You can also think of them as building blocks between those three layers that define how your application's backend will act and interact with your app. Individual Syncano Sockets are easily configured, combined, and created. Some of the Sockets can also easily connect to other services like Mailgun or Segment. It allows you to use every service you want in your application.

You can use Sockets that have already been created by other developers and stored in our Syncano Registry. The Registry is a place in the cloud where you can find Sockets you need, install, and use them in your application. Think of the Syncano Registry as of a grocery store and of Sockets as ingredients for your dinner. And this delicious dinner is the scalable dedicated backend for your app.

You can also create your own Socket using the Syncano CLI. For more information check [Sockets](/building-sockets/basics) section. You can publish it to the Syncano Registry, so that other developers could also use it. This will help to create the ecosystem that everybody can be a part of and bring us closer to our vision of the autonomous developer.

## Simplicity with Flexibility

To go back to the original metaphor, the best way to cook is to do so with ingredients that are less processed. You want to know exactly what you're putting into your meal. The Syncano Sockets let you take charge of this. We don't force you into one specific set of functionality, but instead we give you the tools to build what you need. If you want to send a text message, you should be able to choose what service to use, when and why it happens, and not be restricted by anything! Complete freedom!

If you find Sockets convention interesting, you probably cannot wait any longer to create your first own Socket. In order to do this efficiently, please take a look at a [For Socket Creators](/building-sockets/basics) section.
